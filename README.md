# GestureDetecion_UsingCNN
This is a project from my final project on gesture recognition using CNN, using the tensorkflow framework and Python programming, the detected movements are used to control the motion of the mobile robot, the robot can move forward, backward, turn right and left constantly

I recommend you to do the model training process on a jupyter notebook, and do a test program on the visual studio software
examples of models that have been trained : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IsIrmB3cZweB1a9Z5XDa62ijihOWCbVT?usp=drive_link
